# Conways game of life

## what do

- Grid of some limited size
- there are random tiles on the grid that are alive
- tiles with 1 or less neighbors die
    + kings move neighbors
- if tile has 4 or more neighbors it dies
- otherwise tile lives

## how do

- store a 2d thing (list of lists is fine)
- loop over rows in 2d thing and print
- ` ` for dead `#` for alive

## edge cases

- assume things over the edge are all dead

## corner cases

- assume edge case alplies
