"""Hashiwokakero Generator
Rules
- Connect islands (the circles with numbers) with as many bridges as the number in the island.
- There can be no more than two bridges between two islands.
- Bridges cannot go across islands or other bridges.
- The bridges will form a continuous link between all the islands.

I don't like the idea of an adjancency matrix:
    - some nodes will required multiple edges
    - it won't account for georgraphical constraints
