# The-Archive
A collection of the python projects completed in the [Bristol Python dojo](https://discord.gg/9D9aThSR) run by [Ray](https://github.com/JustCallMeRay)

The Archive is normally updated after every session (once a fortnight) within a day or two. 

Please do not use the code as provided, it is ALWAYS completed in a rush, sometimes does not work and often can be done better! (Hence the restrictive licence.) This is not a repo that is updated and improved!

Recent code owners can be seen on the discord if not included in a file. 

This is currently all done manually, if you would like to automate this (please) consider doing so under [this ticket](https://github.com/Python-Dojo/Dojo-Helper-App/issues/10)
